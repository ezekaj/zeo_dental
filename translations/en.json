Unlike traditional dentures or bridges, implants are surgically placed into the jawbone, where they fuse with the bone through a process called osseointegration. This creates a stable, permanent foundation that looks, feels, and functions exactly like your natural teeth.\n\nAt Zeo Dental Clinic, we use cutting-edge 3D imaging and computer-guided surgery to plan and execute every implant procedure with millimeter precision. Whether you need a single tooth replacement or a full-arch restoration, our specialists ensure optimal placement for maximum longevity and aesthetic results.\n\nWe offer both titanium and zirconia implants, allowing us to customize your treatment based on your specific needs, bone density, and aesthetic preferences. Our commitment to using only premium materials from trusted manufacturers ensures that your implants will serve you well for decades to come.",

          "question": "Am I a good candidate for dental implants?",

Key factors include adequate bone density (which can be enhanced with grafting if needed), healthy gums, and commitment to oral hygiene. During your consultation, we'll evaluate your specific situation and discuss all options."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do dental implants last?",
          "answer": "With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. The implant itself is designed to be permanent, while the crown may need replacement after 15-20 years due to normal wear. Regular check-ups and good oral hygiene are essential for longevity."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the implant procedure painful?",
          "answer": "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during placement. Most patients report that the discomfort afterward is less than expected - often comparable to a tooth extraction. We provide comprehensive aftercare instructions and pain management options."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much do dental implants cost?",
          "answer": "The cost varies depending on the number of implants, type of restoration, and whether additional procedures like bone grafting are needed. During your consultation, we provide a detailed treatment plan with transparent pricing. While implants have a higher upfront cost than other options, their longevity often makes them more economical long-term."

A denture is a removable appliance that replaces multiple or all teeth in an arch. Each has its advantages depending on your specific situation."

          "question": "How long does it take to get used to new dentures?",

        {
          "question": "Can I upgrade from dentures to implant-supported prosthetics?",

          "question": "How do I care for my prosthetics?",
